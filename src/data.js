    title:'The Last of Us Part II',
    desc:' There’s nothing more contagious in video games than sequelitis, but even then, The Last of Us felt like a masterpiece that should have been left alone. Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic action-adventure was a crowning achievement at the end of the PS3’s life cycle, not only reinvigorating tired zombie and post-apocalyptic settings but elevating video game storytelling to the same maturity as any other medium. But after everything Joel and Ellie had been through, surely there was nothing more to add that wouldn’t diminish the power of its divisive and ambiguous ending. Of course, the incredible ‘Left Behind’ DLC proved there were more important stories to tell, while HBO have even greenlit a TV adaptation. So despite a title that’s in danger of becoming a running joke like Final Fantasy, The Last of Us Part II is anything but a superfluous sequel.'

        desc:' Red Dead Redemption 2 has a lot to live up to, not least because it includes people and places from the previous – and much beloved – game. It’s a strange beast, this one: enormous, glorious-looking, and boasting some of the best voice acting ever committed to the medium. Perhaps there should be poetry to describe its beauty. A world devoid of the constant buzzing of electronics you can’t live without in the present day, where nature is the only sound aside from the echo of shotgun fire and the random shouting of strangers stood in dankly lit shacks. Offering you sanctuary, and often met with mistrust and suspicion.'

            desc:' Well that was a surprise! The trailer thats started out looking like another teaser for Horizon: Zero Dawn actually turned out to be a chunky teaser for a new, completely unhinted-at God of War game. Blimey! It’s easy to get confused – this game looks vastly different to everthing that’s gone before it in the series – but having had a special, behind-closed-doors look at the game and a chat with the team that’s making it, we’re starting to piece together the facts at the heart of Kratos’ return.So, with no further ado, here’s everything we know about God of War, along with some of the key questions to which we don’t yet have answers.'

                desc:' The term, much like reboot and re-imagining, has a muddied meaning. It can suggest you’re playing a newer – hopefully better – version of a game you’ve already played, or a completely overhauled take that’s nearly unrecognizable from its source material.Built from the ground up, it’s every bit a brand new game as Resident Evil 7 was when it was released two years ago. In fact, it’s been crafted with the same engine that’s ensured the Baker family still makes regular appearances in our nightmares.'

                    desc:' Japan’s FromSoftware has forged a reputation for making tough-as-nails games, mostly thanks to its more recent slew of action RPG titles: Demon’s Souls, the Dark Souls trilogy and Bloodborne. All make star features of their consistently challenging combat, opaque mechanics and deliberately obtuse storytelling.Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, From’s latest release, looks outwardly similar to the “Soulsborne” games, but needs to be approached in quite a different fashion. In fact, I think it’s arguably harder than any of its From-made predecessors – and likely the most demanding “mainstream” game that’ll be released this year.'

                        desc:' Crossing the finish line in a racing game has never felt as inconsequential as it does in Forza Horizon 4.That’s by no means a knock against the latest entry in Playground Games’ rubber-burning series, but rather the highest compliment you can give a racing game. The simple act of driving, while soaking in some of the most gorgeous sights to ever grace any game, is so satisfying in Forza Horizon 4, the fact you’re actually competing falls to the wayside.That’s not to say winning isn’t rewarding in Forza Horizon 4. On the contrary, leaving the competition in the dust carries its own thrills and rewards. But the blissful act of tearing up the blacktop from behind the wheel of a dream ride was enough to stretch a permanent smile across our face, even when we were dead last.'

                            desc:' For a company famously protective over its IPs, the original Super Mario Maker was something of a bold move from Nintendo.The game presented players with a toolbox all the components (and Goombas) you could possibly need to create a classic 2D side-scrolling Mario level, and essentially challenged them to do a better job than the company’s own design wizards.And what a masterstroke it proved to be. You only have to spend a few minutes on YouTube to get a taste of what the more dedicated members of the game’s online community have been able to come up with, even if getting to the gold requires you to sift through a fair few nightmare-inducing monstrosities in the process.'

                                desc:' 2016’s Doom was a breath of fresh air.Fast, gory, deafeningly loud and unapologetically old-school, id’s soft reboot of its famous series was the shot in the arm we didn’t know the FPS genre needed. And if follow-up Doom Eternal was just more of that, another hundred-mile-an-hour playable metal album, we’d probably be alright with it.With ‘Hell On Earth’ feeling pretty fitting right now, you could argue that Doom Eternal isn’t the escapism you’re after. But of course, with its absolutely ridiculous commitment to ultraviolent excess, iDs sequel is about as effective a tonic as anything right now. Immaculately designed carnage with big-budget sensibilities.'

                                    desc:' For those who owned a Sega Mega Drive in the 90s, chances are your fondest memories were not of a speedy blue hedgehog but battering thugs with a mate on neon-soaked streets. Scrolling beat-em-ups were all the rage back then and Streets of Rage was the king. But the series has stayed dormant since, with shortburst arcade thrills seemingly a thing of the past. It’s then taken a collaboration between like-minded fans and indie developers, all hailing from France no less, to give the Sega series its long-awaited revival.The results are unashamedly old-school, as each punch and kick hits me right in the nostalgic feels, while still being able to bring the series forward to the present day.'
